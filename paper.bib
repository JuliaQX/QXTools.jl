	abstract = {Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from the diverse fields of computer science and computational science to create a new approach to numerical  computing. Julia is  designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be “laws of nature"  by practitioners of numerical computing: {\textbackslash}beginlist {\textbackslash}item  High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. {\textbackslash}item  One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. {\textbackslash}item There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. {\textbackslash}endlist We introduce the  Julia programming language and its design---a  dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch,  a  technique from computer science, picks  the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that  one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new open-source software library Jet, which uses task-based parallelism to obtain speed-ups in classical tensor-network simulations of quantum circuits. These speed-ups result from i) the increased parallelism introduced by mapping the tensor-network simulation to a task-based framework, ii) a novel method of reusing shared work between tensor-network contraction tasks, and iii) the concurrent contraction of tensor networks on all available hardware. We demonstrate the advantages of our method by benchmarking our code on several Sycamore-53 and Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) supremacy circuits against other simulators. We also provide and compare theoretical performance estimates for tensor-network simulations of Sycamore-53 and GBS supremacy circuits for the first time.},

	abstract = {A problem that will benefit from exascale computing is predictive simulation of two- and three-dimensional quantum many-body Hamiltonians. Enabling efficient numerical simulations requires new insights into wavefunction compression that scales on extremely heterogeneous HPC architectures. To address this need, we develop ExaTN: a math library of parallel numerical primitives for processing operations based on hierarchical tensor representations. Our library provides a scalable infrastructure for building a performance portable framework for simulating strongly correlated quantum systems on heterogeneous HPC platforms such as Titan and Summit. Our framework is the first to deliver a massively parallel implementation of the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a promising hierarchical tensor decomposition scheme capable of expressing local expectation values in strongly entangled quantum systems efficiently. In this talk, we will present our integrated framework for processing hierarchical tensor representations on exascale HPC systems via a multi-level asynchronous task-based programming model. This provides scientists with a capability for simulating strongly entangled systems in condensed matter physics. Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program ORNL.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15234},
	abstract = {Simulation of quantum systems is challenging due to the exponential size of the state space. Tensor networks provide a systematically improvable approximation for quantum states. 2D tensor networks such as Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) are well-suited for key classes of physical systems and quantum circuits. However, direct contraction of PEPS networks has exponential cost, while approximate algorithms require computations with large tensors. We propose new scalable algorithms and software abstractions for PEPS-based methods, accelerating the bottleneck operation of contraction and refactorization of a tensor subnetwork. We employ randomized SVD with an implicit matrix to reduce cost and memory footprint asymptotically. Further, we develop a distributed-memory PEPS library and study accuracy and efficiency of alternative algorithms for PEPS contraction and evolution on the Stampede2 supercomputer. We also simulate a popular near-term quantum algorithm, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), and benchmark Imaginary Time Evolution (ITE), which compute ground states of Hamiltonians.},
